1. Convolution: its used to find the similarity of any two objects.
2. Filters/Kernals : its used to check the presence of certain patterns in the 
 image(or any other data), we convolve the filter with image and if its present we will get high value else a lower value.
3. Epochs : its nothing but how many times the training is repeating, on repeating the weights get adjusted more in backpropogation yields to better accuracy.
4. 1x1 Convolution: its used to merge multiple layers(channels) into single. or to extract information from multiple channel and put into another single matrix.
5. 3x3 Convolution : commonly used kernel in Deeplearning. used to extract features. its weights are updated using backprop algorithm.
6. Feature maps: basic element used to extract information from image.
7. Activation Function: its a function which ignor irrelevant things in image using a threshold value.
8. Receptive field: output field created after operation such as convolution or pooling etc.
